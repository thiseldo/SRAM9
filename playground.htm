!!! Spi RAM together with Ethernet Shield

This library makes it possible to use the 23K256 ([[http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/22100D.pdf | Datasheet - PDF]]), 
a 32K SRAM chip from Microchip. The library is an adaptation from the SRAM lib written by Carl Morey.

!! Hardware

Connect the SRAM chip to the arduino pins as follows:

||Function|| 23K256 || Arduino ||
||1||/CS|| 9 ||     
||2||SO|| 12 || 
||3||NC||    ||
||4||GND|| GND ||
||5||SI|| 11 ||
||6||SCK|| 13 ||
||7||/HOLD|| 5V ||
||8||5V||

! Ethernetshield

When you use an older version of the Ethernetshield (without the SD connector) connect pin 2 of the prog connector to
pin 9 of the Arduino. This takes care of disabling the SPI interface of the Ethernetshield during SRAM access.

  
!! Software

The SRAM9 library is an adaptation of the SRAM lib. The main changes are the that pin 9 is used to select the SRAM chip instead of
the pin 10. Furthermore a few digital I/O statements have been changed.
